Who is this app for: People who like watching sitcoms, and want to know some fun facts about their favourite shows. As someone who is a big fan of the above mentioned TV Shows, every once in a while i find myself reading about some of these fun facts about these shows. This could be on facebook, blogs, wikipedia, etc. So I thought, why not make an app that would get all these interesting facts together.

A section that helps you know more about the characters for each of the shows.
